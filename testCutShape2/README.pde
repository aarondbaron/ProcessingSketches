/*
this took a lot of work and websearching.
this is essentially a way to cut any polygon with a slice.
(kinda like fruit ninja..but really is a step towards 
distructible obejects

the class is CutShape.  

demonstration: use the left mouse to slice the shape up.
use the right mouse button to make mutliple slices then press space to cut the shape
or instead, press r to create a random bunch of lines --  then later, press space to cut up the shape.  
1 is for triangle
2 is for square
3. is for a hackish circle..using 30 vertices.  better than actually having to draw curves i guess.



only tested on convex polygons.  only works on convex.. concave has isssues.. need a better algorithm
press c to demonstrate a convex shape and how it messes up.
